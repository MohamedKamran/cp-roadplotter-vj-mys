"""Pretrained pothole models the scripts know how to fetch from Hugging Face.

imgsz is the input size each model was trained at (or the closest size that works
well on the Mac). Metrics are the authors' own numbers on their own test sets, so
they are not comparable with each other; compare on your roads with
